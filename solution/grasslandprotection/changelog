Denton's notes:
Grassland Protection
The Custom TLA tab C645:C693 contains 500. Though the ScenarioRecord for some scenarios specifies 373.11342405, 
that function is broken and a TLA of 500 is used. Update the JSON files to set custom_tla_fixed_value to 500.

Custom PDS Adoption N270 contains 2014, it should be 2018.

The Custom REF Adoption tab supplies no regional data, not even 0. Change the IFERROR value in Helper Tables D28:L73 to 0.0:
=IFERROR(MIN((IF($F$15=1,FORECAST($B28,D$21:D$22,$B$21:$B$22),'Custom REF Adoption'!C26*1)),'Unit Adoption Calculations'!C18),0)
The symptom is that Unit Adoption Calculations Q252 is NaN in Excel and not NaN in Python.

solution/grassland/ca_ref_data/custom_ref_ad_Type_Scenario_1_Name_Here_REF_CASE_.csv extracts one more digit of precision 
for 2018 and 2019 than subsequent years, which breaks a <= check in unitadoption.py:soln_ref_new_iunits_reqd_LAND. 
Edit the CSV file to remove the extra digit of precision from all columns, 2018&2019 should have the same values as 2020+. 
The symptom is that Unit Adoption AG199 is zero in Python and non-zero in Excel.

In Custom PDS Adoption Scenario 4, AF243:AF289 contain a formula of:
=$O$249-SUM($AD$189:AD243)
$AD$189 is copy+paste from scenario 3, change them to $AD$243.
