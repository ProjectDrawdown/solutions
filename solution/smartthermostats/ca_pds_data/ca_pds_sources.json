'Source 1' is from Berg Insight (2015)\n \nStep 2: Using the datapoints for each year available, interpolate on the Data Interpolator with the best fit that seems to fit within the TAM (so in some cases, the adoptions surpassed 7 billion households, which is impossible even in 2060) , and alternative interpolations were used instead). The interpolated values are returned to returned to the Custom Adoption based on GDP sheet.\n\nStep 3: This adoption data are copied to the 'Custom PDS Adoption' Sheet, and details are explained there. \n\nStep 4: On the 'Advanced Controls' sheet, under Adoption Scenario Inputs, 'Fully Customized PDS' is selected, referencing the data listed on 'Custom Adoption'."
