Therefore the operating cost savings per 1,000,000 m3 of water produced (in the REF scenario) is  the cost of the water that would be saved from 1,000,000 m3 of water produced (that is 30% of 35% of 1,000,000 m3 =  107,367 m3). The cost  savings of this amount of water are: 367,690Eur * 107,367 / 2,304,245. This amount is converted to USD in 2014. ",
