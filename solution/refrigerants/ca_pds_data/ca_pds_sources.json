This standardized refrigerant is used to convert between CO2 emissions and Refregerant emissions throughout the analysis. We combine estimates of Refrigerant banks with estimated leakage rates, potential replacement rates of \"overcharged\" banks, retirement-, recovery- and destruction-rates of refrigerants decadally, and sum the net reduction in CO2 emissions expected from these processes. The decadal results are interpolated in the Data Interpolator, mostly with S-Curve fits over the analysis period. Individual HFC sector bank estimates are used (Commercial, Domestic, Mobile and Stationary)."
