Initial 10/2021 extraction of model:

1. Removed all but three of the scenarios from the spreadsheet before generating expected.zip and he code,
so that is all they have.

2. The scenarios referenced 'Drawdown: ALL SOURCES' as the data source for post-2014 pds TAM, and the 
code did not recognize that.  I changed it these to "ALL SOURCES".  That ran, but the TAM was still 
incorrect.  After some digging, I discovered that, while the extractor had created data files for each
of the sources listed on the TAM data pages, the tam_pds_sources.json file referenced the same data files
as the tam_ref_sources.json file, and did not reference the Drawdown_TAM csvs.  I fixed this manually
and submitted a bug.

3. The PDS Adopton data was showing incorrect in an unusual way:  there were off-by-a-row errors,
where the python code was producing a value for year X that the Excel had for year X-1.  Eventually
traced this down to a bug in the Excel Custom PDS tab, where there is literally a row missing in
the tables at AB22 and AQ22: the formula for year 2018 refer to data from row 85, and the formula
for year 2019 refer to data from row 87, skipping row 86.  To fix this, I used the new 
convert_to_cpds.py tool, which created new custom pds adoptions that exactly match what the Excel
has, regardless of how it was obtained.  That seems to have worked...

4. I needed to set Emissions Factors grid_emissions_version to 1.

5. OK, this one is weird: I needed to set UnitAdoption quirks parameter replacement_period_offset to 1.
This is weird because I didn't expect to see it in new models.  But it fixed a *ton* of errors.

Remaining errors are all minor regional errors, or CO2/CH4 errors which I assume are because our
code no longer matches Excel behavior when actual CH4 emissions are involved (though I don't 
know that for a fact)
