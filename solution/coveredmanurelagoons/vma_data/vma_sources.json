See \"Manure Agric Sheet\" in Large Methane Digester Solution model for parameters used  here to convert TWh to Manure.  2014 values in the  Large Methane Digester Solutiion were obtained by applying 70% share to the total generation from IRENA (2016) to represent Agriculture and wastewater only.  Share in total Bioenergy of biogas (if in the results of the sources) produced from Agriculture and Wastewater (WBA, 2013)= 70%\nThe latest 2014-2018 values are based off of IRENA 2019 Renewable Enery Statistics. A  18% share of bigoas in bioenergy is applied, then a 70.2% of biogas is allocated to methane digesters (produced from agriculture and wastewaster). The statistic is based on European and US data. Please see \"2020 Adoption Calcs\" for more info."
