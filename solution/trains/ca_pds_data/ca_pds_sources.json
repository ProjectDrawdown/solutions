        "description": "Electrified railway tkms increase at TWICE the historical average annual rate of track electrification. Using UIC data, we estimate the average electrification rate at 1.4% annually. We double this and use this rate as the optimistically plausible electrification rate. This is reasonable since it still remains below the annual rate of many year's growth according to UIC data below. This may come from increased track length and uniform usage, or higher usage of electrified tracks versus other tracks."

We examine the impact of making this target 100% in 2050 by linearly interpolating between these two percentages. We also assume a doubling of the electrified track usage versus the conventional."
