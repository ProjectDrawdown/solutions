The Commercial / Industrial level discount rate is directly related to decision-making at a Commercial / Industrial level and likely varies greatly across different regions of the world.  Taking the numbers found in the literature above comprises a conservative case.  Without distortions this discount rate would be equivalent to the interest rate afforded by alternative investments available to larger commercial / industrial entities such as multinational corporations or corporate utility enterprises.  Discount rates reported in the literature that are used for policy decisions are not necessarily equivalent to Commercial / Industrial level financial investment decisions, but oftentimes are not distinguished and may be conflated.  These values represent a conservative case and, due to uncertainty, lower and higher discounting rates should probably be used for sensitivity analysis.",
