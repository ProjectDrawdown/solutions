Setting specific parameters for Helper Tables and Unit Adoption were what it
took to get it working:
Helper Tables:
    copy_pds_world_too=True,
    copy_ref_world_too=False,
    copy_pds_to_ref=False,
    copy_ref_datapoint=False,
    copy_pds_datapoint='Ref Table',
    copy_datapoint_to_year=2014,
Unit Adoption:
    replacement_period_offset=0

Deleted 2/3 of the scenarios.  Some were known to be broken, and generally it wasn't
clear that they were useful.

2022-03-18 gerald-scharitzer Update to 2021-08 did not need additional changes.
