In this case, we take the latest data from available developing countries (China and India), and apply those adoption rate estimates to Asia (Sans Japan), Middle East and Africa, and Latin America. We then assume that the adoption rate is fixed for all the historical years in the analysis (2014- current year). The future years have been projected by splitting the current unadopted (single pane) Market (TAM) each year into 1. the existing area from the previous years , 2. new growth in the TAM. The existing area is assumed to be converted to High performance windows at the rate of retrofit, the new growth is converted at a higher rate according to data on sales.
