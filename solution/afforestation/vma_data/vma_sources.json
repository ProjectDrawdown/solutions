    "description": "Costs are sometimes presented per cow rather than per hectare. Number of cows per hectare varies tremendously based on variables like climate, soil quality, age and size of cows, and grazing system. In cases where costs are presented per cow, Drawdown assumes one cow per hectare.  Scarcity and abundance of land resources: competing uses and the shrinking land resource base assumes that each ton of dry matter is sufficient for half a tropical livestock unit (live weight). According to FAO Livestock production in tropical Africa with special reference to the tsetse-afferent zone, a tropical livestock unit is considered to be 250kg live weight, the equivalent of one cow as tropical cattle tend to be smaller than temperate cattle. For temperate and boreal regions one livestock unit is a mature dairy cow, estimated at 1000kg according to the EU Statistics Glossary.\n\nThus Drawdown\u2019s global weighted average of 4.8 tons DM per hectare of grassland  is sufficient to support .61 tons of live weight ruminants which converts to 2.4 tropical livestock units or 0.6 EU livestock units. The total area of temperate grassland is 1768 Mha and tropical is 1819. Thus as a rough estimate, one cow per hectare is acceptable for the purposes of using financial data from grazing studies.\n\nNote: Forest plantations are allocated on degraded land - this present model assumes marginal conventional use of this degraded land areas, principally for grazing. \nIn the absence of sufficient financial data sources documenting the implementation of grazing practices on degraded land, Drawdown\u2019s forest plantation model uses conventional grazing data as a basis for comparison. However, in order to model decreased productivity on degraded land, financial variables for conventional grazing are weighted value based on the proportion of total global grassland area (3514 Mha) that is already degraded (979 Mha), i.e. 27.85%. This calculation is based on Project Drawdown's AEZ values.",

The timber yield (low and high) was available in cubic meter/ha/year for different species across temperate and tropical regions at FAO.
