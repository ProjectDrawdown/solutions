December 2021:
[Meta note: I spent a lot of time debugging an issue that turned out to be Denton's note #2
below.  If I'd just read and executed that first, I would have saved a lot of time... just
sayin']

There only appear to be two "most recent" scenarios.  Taking the 2nd of these to be both PDS2
and PDS3.  (Previously we'd adopted a previous scenario for PDS3, but comparison of the scenarios
showed the differed only by a cost factor, which didn't seem to be kosher, so this seems cleaner.)

On the Adoption tab, regional parameters get misread because the "include?" column is missing.
But it doesn't matter because all the params are default values.  So all I had to do was delete
the confusing-looking comments from the init.py

Denton's Issue #1 to doesn't cause a problem any more, because the table is empty.  However, we
do get an error for table 22 (line 844) because it is missing the 'Add calc above' marker.  Fix
is to add this to the spreadsheet and re-run the extraction.

Issue #2 still holds; fixed as he said.  (BTW for another solution I did enough investigation
to conclude this is an issue inside Excel, and not anything we can do anything about.)

Issue #3 below is still happening. Doing Denton's replacement removed the nan vs non-nan
errors, but left other very minor numerical errors that we will ignore.

At the conclusion we have some key test errors.  These are a result of tests that avoid "meaningless"
cases such as "expected lifetime" being equal to zero, which is how it is set for afforestation.
Just leaving this as is for now, will open an issue to address it more fully.

Denton's notes:
Afforestation
In Drawdown 2020:
1. the headings on the Variable Meta-Analysis C84:M84 have been deleted which makes parsing fail.
Restore them from elsewhere on the sheet.

2. solution/afforestation/ca_ref_data/custom_ref_ad_Type_Scenario_1_Name_Here_REF_CASE_.csv
extracts more digits of precision for 2018 and 2019 than subsequent years, which breaks a <=
check in unitadoption.py:soln_ref_new_iunits_reqd_LAND. Edit the CSV file to remove the extra
digit(s) of precision from all columns, 2018&2019 should have the same values as 2020+.

3. The Custom REF Adoption tab supplies no regional data, not even 0. The symptom is that Unit
Adoption Calculations Q252 is NaN in Excel and not NaN in Python.  The fix is to change the
IFERROR value in Helper Tables D28:L73 to 0.0. E.g.:
=IFERROR(MIN((IF($F$15=1,FORECAST($B28,D$21:D$22,$B$21:$B$22),'Custom REF Adoption'!C26*1)),'Unit Adoption Calculations'!C18),0)
