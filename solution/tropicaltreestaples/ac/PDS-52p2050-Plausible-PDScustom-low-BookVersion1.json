    "description": "The current adoption of this solution is based on the historical data (1962-2012) available on tropical staple crops (avocados, bananas, Brazil nuts, carobs, cashew nuts, coconuts, dates, oil palm, plantains) for different regions from FAO. The data was interpolated to get the current adoption value in the year 2014. The future adoption was also projected based on the historical growth rate with some of the custom scenarios assuming an early growth (60-75%) by 2030. This scenario presents the \"low of all\" PDS custom adoption scenario. The results are marginally higher than the Book Version 1 result, so no separate scenario was stored for the later. This version involves changes in the net profit margin calculation methodology, correction of current adoption value, revision of the custom adoption scenarios, and estimation of operational cost which was missing in the Book Version 1. This solution was allocated both in the cropland and grassland AEZs, so we have created two separate models for this solution. One for the cropland AEZs and one for the grassland AEZs. The model built for the cropland AEZs has only half of the allocated current adoption of this solution, so that model doesn't have any future adoption scenarios and therefore no results were generated there. This model is built for the grassland AEZs, where half of the current adoption and all of the future adoption of this solution is allocated. Thus, for this solution, the results are coming only from this model, although we have created two separate models.",
