Denton's Notes:
Multistrata Agroforestry
Unit adoption in 2015 is zero, so First Cost cell C27 is #DIV/0!. Change cell C27 to:
=IFERROR(C20*(1/C21)^C26,C20)
The Custom TLA tab C645:C693 is empty, and values from the ScenarioRecord are not being populated for some reason.
Paste 360.04639205058 to those cells.
