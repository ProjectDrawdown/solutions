Denton's Notes:
Wind Offshore
In Adoption Data for the World region, the three empty sources "[Source 2 - Conservative]", "[Source 5 - Ambitious]" and "[Source 6 - Ambitious]" 
have data populated for 2012-2017. In most solutions this is not a problem because all of the sources have the same values for these years, 
but for Wind Offshore the 100% Case source uses 41.596 while the rest use 41.604. Both round to 41.60 so Excel makes them look the same, but 
the stddev is not zero. Therefore the denominator for the number of sources matters while calculating the stddev, and the presence of those 
three mostly-empty sources changes the result. Clear the 2012-2017 values from those three.

Also in the adoption data tab the most aggressive case was renamed "100% Case" but the formulae in EF45 is still looking for "100% RES Case". 
Change the formula to "100% Case"
=IF(OR($B$38="ALL SOURCES",$B$38="Baseline Cases",$B$38="Conservative Cases",$B$38="Ambitious Cases",$B$38="100% Case"),
    $C$19,CONCATENATE("Single Source-",LEFT($C$19,1)))
