Taking the numbers found in the literature above comprises a conservative case.  Without distortions this discount rate would be equivalent to the interest rate afforded by alternative investments.  Discount rates reported in the literature that are used for policy decisions are not necessarily relevant for evaluating household level financial investment decisions.  These values represent a conservative case and, due to uncertainty, lower and higher discounting rates should probably be used for sensitivity analysis."
