The total addressable market was constrained to 90% substitution, assuming 10% of market will be captive to traditional plastics due to nature of use. A 3rd degree polynomial trendline was used to interpolate data between 2023-2060, assuming that 13% of the replaceable market will be bioplastics by 2050, based on the average of baseline adoption scenarios. A further constraint on available feestock was applied based on Project Drawdown analysis."
