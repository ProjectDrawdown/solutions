Update 2/2022 --- updating to 2021 model

Custom adoption is computed (you can see, for example, formulas in cells B571:B613, which is
the custom adoption for PDS3).  The fix to this is manually load each scenario, and copy the
custom adoption data (from the custom adoption tab or the helper tables tab) to the
corresponding custom adoption csv file.
