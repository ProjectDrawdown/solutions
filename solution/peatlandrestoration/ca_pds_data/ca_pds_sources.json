In the case of Indonesia, the comitment is to restore 2 Mha of degraded peatland by 2020 which represents 49% of degraded peatland area. The Uk's Peatland strategy aims for \u201cTwo million hectares of peatland in good condition, under restoration or being sustainably managed by 2040.\u201d representing 96% of degraded peatland area. The weighted average of both comitments is 65% of degraded peatland area. We take a conservative approach and assume it will be achieved in 2040 and scale up the 65% comitment to the world.
