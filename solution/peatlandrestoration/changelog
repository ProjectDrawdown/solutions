The extractor sets the copy_pds_to_ref quirk unnecessarily, because the common values are all zeros.
I deleted those params.  (Same was true before, actually, I just hadn't noticed it.)

Fixed "by accident":  Removing older scenarios means that the remaining scenarios have the same values
as the Excel workbook when it was saved.... so the calculated adoptions and the stored adoptions are
the same.

This falls under the category of "OK for now but needs additional work" in order to implement the 
custom code for calculating adoptions.

I needed to add a line to data/land/aez/solution_aez_matrix.csv for this solution. 
I copied the line for the other peatlands solution, assuming it would be the same.

Test failure in verify_custom_adoption (1). The extraction code is assuming that a custom adoption has a fixed 
set of sources with fixed 'include' parameters ("Custom Ref Adoption"!S25:S34). In peatland restoration, 
these values vary by scenario.   General code enhancement fixed this.

Test failure in verify_custom_adoption (2). Even with the fix above, the results are still wrong. Investigation 
shows that the problem is that the data sources themselves are parameterized by scenario-specific factors. 
For example, the value of `"Custom Ref Adoption"!B86" is 1.5068 when the workbook is initially opened, 
but 1.826069903 when scenario "PDS-57p2050-PDS 2019 Plausible- Low of All" is loaded.
I've stopped here because going from fixed CSV files for a custom adoption source to a parameterized value 
is a pretty big change; I want to discuss with @chadfrisch what the right course of action is.

    Denton notes:

    A number of the Land solutions do this. The code generator doesn't handle it, but a number of the solutions 
    have been constructed manually. For example:

    Conservation Agriculture
    Farmland Restoration
    the existing Peatlands solution

    All of those were done by hand, I never came up with a reasonable way for the code generator to handle 
    arbitrary formulae created by the human researcher.

    Subsequent updates of the solution involved re-running the code generator, then manually restoring 
    the Custom PDS code which the code generator would overwrite, before git commit.

So next steps are to do the same for this solution.
