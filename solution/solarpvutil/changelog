Nov 2021 update

1) The VMA Solar PV Module Learning Rate at row 1272 is malformed: it has been extended by one
line, overwriting the '**Add calc above' that the VMA reader looks for to find the end of the
table.  Insert a new line afterwards and add the '**Add calc above' text where it belongs.  You
will also have to adjust the table at right so that the summary block begins on the correct
line, or you will get errors about not being able to convert 'Average' to a boolean, or to be
able to find the lower bound.

2) The original PDS TAM data sources have names that are both long and confusing, like this:
    Drawdown TAM: Drawdown TAM - 100%RES - Drawdown Scenario
In the official data sources, I simplified the names down to this:
    PD Integrated TAM - Drawdown Scenario
I ended up adding code to the extractor to automatically rename these TAM sources to these names,
but next iteration, this should be examined again.

3) Denton's comment below still applies.  It has a weird effect, though: it causes the adoption to
be interpreted as a single source, which is arguably a more sensible thing than treating it as
a group.  Still, fixed it the same way that he did.

4) The ref helper tables were off by a bit, because the percentage calculation is being taken from 2014
instead of the base year, which is 2018.  Fixed this by changing the year on line 95 to 2014.


Denton's Notes:
Solar PV Utility
In Drawdown 2020 in the adoption data tab the most aggressive case was renamed "100% Case" but the formulae in EF45 
is still looking for "100% RES Case". Change the formula to "100% Case"
=IF(OR($B$38="ALL SOURCES",$B$38="Baseline Cases",$B$38="Conservative Cases",$B$38="Ambitious Cases",$B$38="100% Case"),
    $C$19,CONCATENATE("Single Source-",LEFT($C$19,1)))
