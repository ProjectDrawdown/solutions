Denton's Notes:
InstreamHydro
The "Baseline Cases", "Ambitious Cases", etc headers were removed from all regions in TAM Data, which breaks 
tools/solution_xls_extract parsing. Copy that header from another solution.

Small Hydro (different model?):
The Custom REF Adoption tab deleted the "Include?" settings from S24:T34. Copy them from another spreadsheet, 
and set the first four to Yes. Otherwise the class is generated with all custom_ref_data_sources disabled. 
(Note: columns S and T, the other thing Small Hydro did is shorten the column ranges used for names)

The Custom REF Adoption tab supplies no regional data, not even 0. Change the IFERROR value in Helper Tables D28:L73 to 0.0:
=IFERROR(MIN((IF($F$15=1,FORECAST($B28,D$21:D$22,$B$21:$B$22),'Custom REF Adoption'!C26*1)),'Unit Adoption Calculations'!C18),0)
