Denton's Notes:
Wind Onshore
In the adoption data tab the most aggressive case was renamed "100% Case" but the formulae in EF45 is still looking for 
"100% RES Case". Change the formula to "100% Case"
=IF(OR($B$38="ALL SOURCES",$B$38="Baseline Cases",$B$38="Conservative Cases",$B$38="Ambitious Cases",$B$38="100% Case"),
    $C$19,CONCATENATE("Single Source-",LEFT($C$19,1)))
