Per 20Mlmh, and the share of manufacturing was said to be at 7%. It is not sure whether the carbon footprint is equal to GWP (converted from fossil C using ratio of 3.667/500). The original Shahzad et al. data was many times lower compared to the average and all other data points for incandescent , CFL and LED lamps. It's assumed that there is some inconsistency with the conversion from fossil C to carbon footprint: Shahzad et al. used a ratio of 3.667/500 but it potentially should have been only 3.667. As a result, the Shahzad data is multiplied with 500 resulting to CO2 amount of manufacturing in the same ballpark as other sources (except for CFL, which is on the high side with this conversion). Shahzad et al. paper is from a peer-reviewed scientific journal (Chemical Engineering Transactions) but it is not a journal specialised in environmental assessments or life cycle assessment studies or LCA methodology, which may explain the inconsistency.",1.0

It is stated to have a ""common basis for comparison"" as a luminous flux ranging between 345 and 420 lm (""comparable luminous flux""), but this is not exactly comparable.",
