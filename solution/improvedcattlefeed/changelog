Original import, 10/2021:
I had to change the name of the "pds_source_post_2014" field in all the scenarios.  
As extracted it was something like "Tam Drawdown: ALL SOURCES", and I changed it to "ALL SOURCES"
The extracted value gave a "no such source" error.

Also, the regional tables in the TAM data had formulas in the empty columns, which was making the
columns read at zero, throwing off all the min/max/sd type calculations to the right.
This is clearly wrong, so I cleared the contents of those columns in the Excel, then re-extracted
the expected.zip file.  This magically fixed all test errors.
A final thing I did was add one line to the CO2 calcs initialization:  as generated, it read:

        self.c2 = co2calcs.CO2Calcs(ac=self.ac,
            ch4_ppb_calculator=self.c4.ch4_ppb_calculator(),
            soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved=self.ua.soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved(),
            ....

I changed it to read:

        self.c2 = co2calcs.CO2Calcs(ac=self.ac,
            ch4_ppb_calculator=self.c4.ch4_ppb_calculator(),
            ch4_megatons_avoided_or_reduced=self.c4.ch4_megatons_avoided_or_reduced(),
            soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved=self.ua.soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved(),
            ....

I did this because this is what Kristina did for solutions that produce greenhouse gasses directly (which
this one does).  In this case, however, it doesn't seem to have changed the results at all, and the
tests are still passing.  (Note: I didn't add a N2O handler because this solution doesn't involve directly
N2O emissions, at least not according to the ac.n2o_co2_per_funit value.)
