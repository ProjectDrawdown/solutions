Original import, 10/2021:
I had to change the name of the "pds_source_post_2014" field in all the scenarios.  
As extracted it was something like "Tam Drawdown: ALL SOURCES", and I changed it to "ALL SOURCES"
The extracted value gave a "no such source" error.

Also, the regional tables in the TAM data had formulas in the empty columns, which was making the
columns read as zero, throwing off all the min/max/sd type calculations to the right.
This is clearly wrong, so I cleared the contents of those columns in the Excel, then re-extracted
the expected.zip file.

Also had to set the mysterious replacement_period_offset to 1.

A final thing I did was add one line to the CO2 calcs initialization:  as generated, it read:

        self.c2 = co2calcs.CO2Calcs(ac=self.ac,
            ch4_ppb_calculator=self.c4.ch4_ppb_calculator(),
            soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved=self.ua.soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved(),
            ....

I changed it to read:

        self.c2 = co2calcs.CO2Calcs(ac=self.ac,
            ch4_ppb_calculator=self.c4.ch4_ppb_calculator(),
            ch4_megatons_avoided_or_reduced=self.c4.ch4_megatons_avoided_or_reduced(),  <<-- new line
            soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved=self.ua.soln_pds_net_grid_electricity_units_saved(),
            ....

I did this because this is what Kristina did for solutions that produce greenhouse gasses directly (which
this one does), but I'm not totally sure what impact it has.  The CO2 and CH4 results are still not passing
tests, but that is expected because our new code is different.
