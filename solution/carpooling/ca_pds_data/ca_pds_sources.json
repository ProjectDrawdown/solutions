We assume that that figure is out of a maximum as entered on Advanced Controls (~3 persons per trip) and estimate what effective adoption share the target load factor represents (assuming that all trips are either single occupancy or the maximum entered. This load factor in 2050 and that in 2014 (current value) are interpolated to get the load factor each year which is used to estimate the adoption.\nRecent Historical adoptions were estimated by assuming that the average load factors calculated from the weighted available data are applied to the total urban mobility each year after applying the car mode share (assumed fixed)"
