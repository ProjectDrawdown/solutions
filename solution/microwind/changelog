Denton's Notes:
Microwind
In the Drawdown 2020 version, the Adoption Data tab has rearranged all regions and also entered two datapoints for each region, 
which Excel then extrapolates out to 2060. The regional results are 10x the World result, and therefore nonsensical. 
There are also no data sources listed. Remove all of the regional datapoints.
