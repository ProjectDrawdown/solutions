Deleted the three 2020 scenarios since one of them broke with a missing TAM.
Two of the scenarios had pds adoption overrides set, in spite of the model using copy_pds_to_ref.  When we disallowed recursion
between pds/ref helpertables functionality, this broke.  I fixed it by removing the adoption overrides ("pds_adoption_use_ref_years"),
which weren't accomplishing anything useful anyway.

Denton's Notes:
Concentrated Solar
AdoptionData for Latin America has a 0.0 in 2020 for all sources but one. solution_xls_extract.xls treats these zeros as NaN, 
because in most of the other solutions that is what it means, but here it is important. Update the following files to change the 
Latin America column in 2020 to 0.0:
ad_based_on_AMPERE_2014_MESSAGE_MACRO_550.csv
ad_based_on_AMPERE_2014_IMAGE_TIMER_550.csv
ad_based_on_AMPERE_2014_IMAGE_TIMER_450.csv

HelperTables B21 is still 2014, but the spreadsheet nonetheless uses 2018 as its base year. Update B21 to 2018.

In Emissions Factors, empty rows were inserted starting at A40. Copy the data from lower in the sheet back into place.

The Custom REF Adoption tab supplies no regional data, not even 0. Change the IFERROR value in Helper Tables D28:L73 to 0.0:
=IFERROR(MIN((IF($F$15=1,FORECAST($B28,D$21:D$22,$B$21:$B$22),'Custom REF Adoption'!C26*1)),'Unit Adoption Calculations'!C18),0)
The symptom is that Unit Adoption Calculations Q252 is NaN in Excel and not NaN in Python.

In ScenarioRecord for the Book Ed 1 Drawdown and Optimum scenarios, "Years with Y-PDS" is set which results in a 
circular reference due to the way baseline years were added in the 2020 results. Clear cells E683 and E910.

ConcentratedSolar should set bug_cfunits_double_count=True, but the scenario loaded in the file has all regional 
adoption set to 0 in advanced controls to tools/solution_xls_extract.py cannot figure this out. 
Set bug_cfunits_double_count=True in solution/concentratedsolar/__init__.py
