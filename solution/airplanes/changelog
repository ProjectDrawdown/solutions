Denton's notes:
Airplanes
TAM Data starting at S46 (min/max/sd) entered hard-coded constants, not formulae, and the constants are wrong
for the TAM Data entered. Paste in formulae from some other spreadsheet.

Update 2022:
The same issues Denton found previously still applied, and were fixed in the Excel prior to
making the expected.zip file.

Additionally, we found that the Custom Ref Adoption table is computed via a scenario-dependent
formula, which the extractor doesn't know  how to deal with.  Fixed this manually by creating
two custom ref files (the values for scenarios 1 and 2 were the same), manually pasting the
PDS1 and 2 data into the second file, and changing the scenarios to load the correct custom ref
file.  With this change, all tests pass.

(Meta note: it looks to me as though the intent for the custom ref adoption was to use a fixed
set of historical data, then revert to the standard %-of-TAM for future-looking data.  At some
point we should enable a fixed history as a built-in capability, in which case this model could
revert to a standard ref adoption.)
