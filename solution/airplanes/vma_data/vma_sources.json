    "description": "The definition of \"efficient aircraft\" is those Single Aisle and Small/Medium Twin Aisle aircraft produced from around 2015 that provide around 15-20% improvement over average fleet aircraft of the same class. These include only B777X, B737 MAX, B787, A320neo, A330neo and A350 XWB. The orders for these are obtained from the manufacturers along with their typical capacities. Operations to estimate the average annual work come from the combination of theoretical calculations from peer reviewed research and airline flight-hour usage data from the Airline Commerce Journal for four popular aircraft series. See \"Aircraft Passenger km estimate\" for more details.",

The differences of these aircraft are generally newer engines (re-engining), wingtips and lightweighting, and we assume that the cost of retrofitting older aircraft with these same technologies is approximately the same. Weights are based on the projected future sales of aircraft in each category according to Boeing and Airbus market forecasts.",

The Commercial / Industrial level discount rate is directly related to decision-making at a Commercial / Industrial level and likely varies greatly across different regions of the world.  Taking the numbers found in the literature above comprises a conservative case.  Without distortions this discount rate would be equivalent to the interest rate afforded by alternative investments available to larger commercial / industrial entities such as multinational corporations or corporate utility enterprises.  Discount rates reported in the literature that are used for policy decisions are not necessarily equivalent to Commercial / Industrial level financial investment decisions, but oftentimes are not distinguished and may be conflated.  These values represent a conservative case and, due to uncertainty, lower and higher discounting rates should probably be used for sensitivity analysis.",
