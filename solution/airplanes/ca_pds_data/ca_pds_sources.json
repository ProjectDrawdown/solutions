    "description": "Taking the production rate of aircraft  by the two major suppliers - Airbus and Boeing, we project the production of \"efficient model\" aircraft over the future. We also assume that a third manufacturer enters the market (possibly COMAC or UAC) in 2025 and produces first single aisle then twin aisle aircraft of competitive quality. 100 aircraft per year are retrofitted to equivalent new-aircraft efficiency. Each aircraft in the fleet is assumed to work around  an average number of passenger-km per year according to an estimate for each of single aisle and twin aisle from our brief schedule calculations including downtime for maintenance checks, and new models are 1SD below the average estimated efficiency improvement (~13%). We assume that the production rate of the big players remains constant, but that the newcomer increases production annually. ",
