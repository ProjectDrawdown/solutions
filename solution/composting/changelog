Denton's Notes:

In Adoption Data cells U46:U94, the final term of the conditional is 'STDEV.P(C46:M46)' which means the Standard Deviation does not 
include the regional sum in column Q. In SolarPVUtil and other solutions where the Adoption Data extends a few more columns, the 
Standard Deviation does include the regional sum. It is nonsensical to include the regional sum in the mean but not the standard deviation. 
We update the last STDEV.P in U46:U94 to be STDEV.P(C46:Q46).

VMA #27 deleted the "**Add calc above" string from column L, which is how vma_xls_extract.py identifies the bottom of the VMA. Put it back.
