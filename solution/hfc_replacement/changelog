November 2021 denise

Importing the new version.  The weirdness Daniel encountered with adoptions seems to have
been removed --- this was a very vanilla import: a couple of TAM parameters and some
changed helper tables quirks.

Several changes to the general code allow hfc_replacement to past tests:
- The zip extractor was changed (some time ago) to handle special characters in names
- I changed the "approx equal" test in the expected result tester to allow inf == nan
- I changed code in operatingcost.py that used first_valid_index() to use dd.CORE_START instead
(first_valid_index was returning null because there was no valid data in the table)

With these changes, the tests are clean and none need to be skipped.

I fixed the erroneous space in the expect.zip file, so that scenario can now be loaded.
If this solution is extracted again, it will need to be redone: after running the macros, find
the index file and hand-edit it to remove the space.
I also added checks to the model financial analysis code so that no exceptions are raised
(and thus the modification to expected_result_tester is no longer required.)
I haven't checked or verified any of the other issues.

hfc_replacement initial Python port.
Automated extraction worked only partially with hfc_replacement. For example, 
ad data was not extracted at all. To accomodate this, a custom version of
solution_xls_extract.py was create (now in solutions/limbo). There, change to
write_ad(f, wb, outputdir) were necessary. Specifically, the call to
extract_source_data did not work well for hfc_replacement.
I also had to comment out 2 lines in write_custom_ad.
hfc_replacement does not perform any financial analysis. Financials must
therefore be excluded from testing.
One change in expected_result_tester.py was necessary. In RRS_solution_verify_list,
verify_operating_cost(obj, verify) cannot be called for hfc_replacement.
In ca_pds_data/custom_pds_ad_PDS_1_Lower_Adoption_LowGWP.csv I had to manually
change the World value for the Year 2014.
I also had to hardcode fix a bug in the solutions __init__.py that related to the
definition of ht_ref_adoption_final.
Scenario 0 currently passes the tests that are not skipped. Scenarios 1 and 2
are still raising errors that I was unable to trace.
