8/9/2021: Notes for first complete extraction

This is only a partial implementation of this model:  Sustainable Clothing has a lot
of custom modeling done on tabs like 'Supply Chain Inputs' that is not reflected in the
python code currently.  In the future, this model should probably have custom extensions
to handle that functionality.

The standard HT fixes were needed.  The settings for this solution ended up
being:
Change the start date for ht_ref_adoption_final from 2014 to 2018 (line 256)
Set these HT flags:
    copy_pds_to_ref=False,
    copy_pds_datapoint=True,
    copy_ref_datapoint=True,
    copy_datapoint_to_year=2014,
    copy_pds_world_too=True,
    copy_ref_world_too=True,

In __init__.py, I moved the block of code that creates a CustomAdoption inside the 
if self.ac.soln_pds_adoption_basis == 'Fully Customized PDS' condition.
This avoids an error when ac.soln_pds_adoption_scenarios_included isn't set (which happens
if the adoption is of a different kind).  This code structure seems more correct, and maybe
it should default this way.

A couple of values on the Advanced Controls tab are set from values on other tabs that are
_not_ managed by ScenarioRecord.  This leads to a situation where when we load data from
a scenario, we get the correct historical value, but the spreadsheet gets whatever happens
to be on that other tab.  In this case, the values affected are conv_emissions_per_funit and 
soln_emissions_per_funit, and in the Excel they are loaded from the Supply Chain Inputs tab.
Dealt with this by disabling the affected tests.

Finally, deleted scenario PDS3-56p2050-Dec20.  This scenario appears on the ScenarioRecord tab,
but not in the Scenarios dropdown in the spreadsheet, and it is incomplete and cannot be 
loaded properly.


7/2021 original notes:
@nelsonkcheng did the initial investigation; results captured in the notebook in the notes/ folder.
Note that the fixes, by setting specific values in __init__.py, are probably not the right way
to address these issues.

There were known bugs in code that generated the expected.zip files.  After correcting for that
I find the first initial error in Helper Tables, which probably means it is in the same class of
errors that is being investigated in Issue #362.
