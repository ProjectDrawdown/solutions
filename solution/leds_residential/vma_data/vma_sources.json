As there are several conventional lighting technologies, weighing is needed. The Conventional First Cost is calculated using weighted average of first costs for conventional lighting technologies used in residential lighting. The weight is the share of market (market share, no data in Plmh shares available) of the given technology in total global lighting market share (value-based). These market shares are taken from the McKinsey (2012) report. The weights are converted to account for 97% of lighting service. The sum of weights is less (97%) than 1 because not all lighting technologies in use were considered in conventional: LED lighting (accounting for 3 %) is considered as a solution, not as part of the conventional lighting technologies. Installing costs are estimated to be 0USD in residential lighting. Total weight for a particular conventional technology sums to market share for all entries in table."
