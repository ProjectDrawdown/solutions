        "description": "Using estimated projections of e-bike sales from Navigant, and Bloomberg, along with estimated growth rates of sales for missing years, and assumed bike lifetimes (really battery lifetimes as these dominate), estimated e-bike stocks are developed for each Drawdown region (OECD90, Eastern Europe, Asia sans Japan, Middle East and Africa and Latin America). These are assumed to each have a fixed number of passenger-km per year based on 10 km per workday and 5km per weekend day with a ridership of 1.05 considering the popularity of multiple riders on Chinese e-bikes. the resulting passenger-km are summed for global results."
