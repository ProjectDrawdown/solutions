Drawdown calculations based on EIA EV Price projections,https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo,OECD90,USA,2 - Public Sector/ Multilateral Agency,2017,,,,0.0141,%,,"Using total dataset, we summarize the production (ignoring replacement) and weighted prices for 100- and 200-mile Evs along with PHEV-10 and PHEV-40. Using the calculator at bottom of this sheet, the estimated Learning Rate for three scenarios is estimated: Reference, Low Oil Price and Low Oil Price Gas Resource and Technology.",
