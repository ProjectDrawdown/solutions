I needed to set helpertables copy_ref_datapoint = False

On the adoption tab, someone had put in '-' (the minus character) in early data instead of NaN, which confused pandas
into interpreting the data as object, which messed up all the ensuing math.  I deleted the '-' characters and
re-extracted, which fixed the problem.
