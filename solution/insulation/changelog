Denton's Notes:
Insulation
In ScenarioRecord, the NPV is recorded as 0,04 as it was saved by a research fellow in a region which uses comma as a 
decimal separator. tools/solution_xls_extract.py actually handles this correctly and emits 0.04 for the solution it is 
generating, but when Excel loads this scenario it turns the NPV into 40,000% and the results are comical.
Change the NPV to 0.04 in ScenarioRecord.
