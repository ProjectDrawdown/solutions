Denton's Notes:
Ocean Power
Regional Adoption data still has the constants for 2012-2014 for the China, India, EU, USA regions, 
which makes the trend computation try to predict something. Remove the constants.

Helper Tables C31 links to the PDS data for 2018, which is one more year than the other energy models do. 
Restore the formula using cell C32.

Similar to the other Drawdown2020 energy models like SolarPV, in the adoption data tab the most aggressive
case was renamed "100% Case" but the formulae in EF45 is still looking for "100% RES Case". However for Ocean Power, 
fixing EF45 results in negative adoption for the years 2018-2022 and this makes First Cost not work. Change 
ScenarioRecord E1557 to 'Based on: average of Greenpeace Advanced Energy Revolution (2015) and Ecofys (2018)' 
to get an actual single source matching the Excel behavior.
