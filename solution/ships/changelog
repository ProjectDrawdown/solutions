Note 8/2021:
There is a known test failure with this solution in the TAM module.
The root cause is probably that in the spreadsheet the Baseline Cases are 
empty after the historical years, which causes the SD calculation to croak.

I am not going to fix this because the next version of the ship model has 
different data and different scenarios, and I suspect those will fix
the issue. 

Update 2/2022:
...And it is true, the new scenarios pass with no difficulties.
