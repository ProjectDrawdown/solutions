Denton's Notes:
Hybrid Cars
ScenarioRecord cells E743, E746, E760, E761, E769, E787 use comma separators and need to be changed to period.
FirstCost cells C37:C82 contain "('Unit Adoption Calculations'!AY###)^C$26)", and Excel implements 0^0 as NaN 
instead of 1. Python implements 0^0 as 1.
Update the formula in C37:C82 in two places to add an IF, for example for C37:
=IF('Advanced Controls'!$C$117="Y",(C$27*(IF(C$26=0,1,('Unit Adoption Calculations'!AY137)^C$26)))*$F$15,
    MAX((C$27*(IF(C$26=0,1,('Unit Adoption Calculations'!AY137)^C$26)))*$F$15,O37))
