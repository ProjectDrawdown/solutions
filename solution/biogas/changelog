Denton's Notes:
Biogas:
A number of the regions have no Adoption Data except for hard-coded constants for 2012-2014. This makes the Python implementation 
try to fit a trend to that data, which does not match the Excel behavior. Zero out 2012-2014 of regional adoption sources which 
are not populated with other data.

In India and EU regions, update "Based on IEA ETP 2016" source to "Based on IEA ETP 2016 - 6DS" and same for 4DS and 2DS.
