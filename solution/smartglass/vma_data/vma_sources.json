        "description": "For energy implications, we focus on the architectural/buildings smart glass market. Smart glass sales have been chiefly to the automotive market recently however, so we need to take that into account in the estimations above. Additionally, the functional unit of the model is m2 of commercial floor area with the solution implemented which is assumed linear in total glazed area. The ratio of glazed area to floor area is assumed fixed and set on Advanced Controls. The total smart glass market is dominated by the automotive market, and so this fraction is removed from the raw data above using the data from http://www.bccresearch.com/market-research/advanced-materials/smart-glass-technologies-avm065a.html "

The weightings factors are derrived from the weighted average of each buildng type as explained in Table 42 of Deru et al 2011. Weighting factors in addition to calculation of the building geometries are summarized in the WinFloorArea additional sheet. The window to floor area ratio is scaled by 0.75 to represent installing dynamic windows only on 3 facades of the building which can be adjusted in cell L863. Installing windows on more facades does not increase the energy savings potential and has the potential (depending on the climate zone) to reduce the energy savings of the building."

The Commercial / Industrial level discount rate is directly related to decision-making at a Commercial / Industrial level and likely varies greatly across different regions of the world.  Taking the numbers found in the literature above comprises a conservative case.  Without distortions this discount rate would be equivalent to the interest rate afforded by alternative investments available to larger commericial / industrial entities such as multinational corporations or corporate utility enterprises.  Discount rates reported in the literature that are used for policy decisions are not necessarily equivalent to Commercial / Industrial level financial investment decisions, but oftentimes are not distiguished and may be conflated.  These values represent a conservative case and, due to uncertainty, lower and higher discounting rates should probably be used for sensitivity analysis."
