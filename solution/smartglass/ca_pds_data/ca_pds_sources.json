        "description": "For near term forecasts to 2022, we use the historical and trend data estimated by Navigant Research (2012). For the far future, we use the World's Green Buildings Council target of 100% net zero buildings by 2050 (all buildings consume net zero energy/produce onsite or produce net zero carbon emissions). We take a more conservative number of 30% smart glass adoption since some buildings in colder climates wouldn't gain significantly from smart windows, and others may use diferent technologies. These data points (in m2 of smart glass area) are interpolated using a 3rd degree polynomial curve (on Data Interpolator). They are then converted to m2 of commercial floor area using the Window-to-floor area ratio on this sheet."

For the far future, we use the World's Green Buildings Council target of 100% net zero buildings by 2050 (all buildings consume net zero energy/produce onsite or produce net zero carbon emissions). We take a more conservative but still rather ambitious number of 75% smart glass adoption in this scenario for illustration of the potential of Smart glass.

        "description": "Similarly to the Updated Scenario 3 above, this scenario assumes a near term growth according to Navigant data and then interpolates those values to 75% adoption in 2050 according to the Net Zero buildings goal. The results are slightly different owing to the slight methodological changes between the Drawdown Book edition 1 and the current model version."
