Denton's Notes:
Conservation Agriculture
The Custom PDS Adoption tab is initially filled with #VALUE errors, as it uses LINEST and isn't populated. Go to the 
ScenarioRecord to load the first scenario, then switch to Custom PDS Adoption and check that it calculated, then switch 
to the License tab as we want that to be the one which opens, then save the file.
