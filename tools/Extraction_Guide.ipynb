The extractor traditionally tried to keep up to date with which models would have which varients, but that code is inevitably brittle, so I've put less emphasis on that.  Instead, read the documentation on the Helper Tables `init` options, look at the Excel formulas, and set the arguments appropriately.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " * Sometime VMA data is missing.  This can particularly happen when proprietary data is removed from the Excel model.  This will usually show up as an error trying to load the VMA data, and may also show up as the Excel model computing nan where the python code computes a number. Fix the first part (loading the VMA) by changing the entries in the scenario files.  Change them from something like this:\r\n",

    "  tests on a permanent basis. \r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "  * Sometimes Excel workbooks compute values on the Advanced Controls tab, and those computations override the Scenario values.  In Excel, when you load a scenario, it copies all the scenario information from the ScenarioRecord tab into the places it belongs on the Advanced Controls tab.  But some Excel workbooks have created additional computations to calculate those values, and the formula overrides the scenario value. The correct thing to do here is to remove the offending formula from the Excel, and re-create the expected.zip file with it out of the way.\r\n",

    "## When comparing to Excel, make sure you've loaded the right Scenario\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "On the `ScenarioRecord` tab, cell `B9` shows the currently loaded scenario.  When a workbook is first opened, this is usally empty, meaning you don't know which scenario was last loaded.  Select the scenario you are debugging against from the dropdown, and click on 'Load Scenario'.\r\n",

    "## Compare your Excel solution to other solutions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If you think the python code seems to be doing the wrong thing, it may be that your Excel workbook has a different implementation than other workbooks.\r\n",
