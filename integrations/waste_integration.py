# TEMPORARY SNAPSHOT identifies inputs that are obtained from local data files that
# should be fetched from other models, but we either don't have the model at all (the food model),
# or we haven't implemented that part of the model.  When we do get those implemented, we should
# replace the snapshot a live data fetch.   Note these are _not_ the same as testmode snapshots,
# which are meant to be used in place of live data for testing purposes only.
