This directory contains the code that generates the online version of the documentation at
[https://projectdrawdown.github.io/solutions/].

The builddocs.sh script is run automatically by Github Actions whenever changes are published to the 
develop branch. The script saves the resulting html into the `gh-pages` branch (and should never be checked in to any other
code branch)

The code that actually creates the documentation is in `runpdoc.py`.
If you want to run it locally, manually (e.g. if you are testing out modifications to the documentation),
you will need to start by installing [pdoc](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc):
```
pip install pdoc
```

Then you can generate the documentation from this directory by executing the following command from this
directory.
```
python runpdoc.py 
```

The `rundoc.py` script is also where to customize what documentation is created.  In particular, you can customize
* The list of documents to include in the top section
* The list of modules to include in the API section
