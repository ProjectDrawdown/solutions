# Project Drawdown Model Engine

[Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/) is the most comprehensive plan yet published for how to solve Global Warming. Project Drawdown entered the climate conversation with the [publication of the 2017 book](https://www.drawdown.org/the-book). With [The Drawdown Review in 2020](https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework/drawdown-review-2020), the project continues its mission to inspire and communicate solutions.

The Project Drawdown models are, at their core, economic models which estimate the total global and regional demand for each solution and the percentage of that demand each year which might adopt the Drawdown solution. The monetary and emissions impacts of that adoption are then calculated.  The framework and methodology for the model was developed by a core research team at Project Drawdown with senior research fellows and visiting researchers from each of the relevant solution domains, over the course of a number of years. The models were originally constructed in some ~80 Excel files.

This repository is a conversion of the original Excel models into python.  This includes both the analytical parts of the model, and the summary data used to produce key results.
Our goal is to enable:
   + ongoing research by Project Drawdown and other researchers
   + use of this research in other projects, including a broader audience of policy makers, business leaders, and other interested parties.
Future updates to the research will be published in this repository.

Whilst this repo covers the model and analytics in the form of a python library, our [sister project](https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/global-research-platform) develops that into a server-based solution and a researcher-aimed UI.

## Status

Conversion Status:
  * Almost all of the solutions (technologies) have been converted.
  * New solutions are converted as they become released from Project Drawdown research.
  * Core calculations (used to generate the core results) are completed
  * Most of the "secondary calculations" (which are used to do solution-specific generation of, e.g. emissions factors or adoption estimates) are _not_ yet implemented.
  * The overall integration between multiple solution models (used to model, for example, the impact of adopton of one solution on demand for another) is work in progress.

Other work in progress:
  * Continuing work to make the interfaces more accessible to folks outside the Project Drawdown community, both in terms of code improvements and documentation.

# Using the PDME

## Getting the source code


You can [create your own fork of this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
using the `Fork` button at the top of the screen.  From there, follow the instructions to download your fork to your computer.


If you are going to change the code, we recommend immediately making your own branch:
```sh
      $ git checkout -b <your-branch-name-here>
```


## Development Environment

We recommend using [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create a development environment for this project.
Once miniconda is installed, the following command will create a development environment named `pd-dev` that includes this code, all the
dependencies it requires, and some useful tools such as [pytest](https://pytest.org) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

```sh
      $ conda env create -f environment.yml
      $ conda activate pd-dev
```

A good way to explore the code is to start jupyter notebook

```sh
      $ jupyter notebook
```

then click on `Start_Here.ipynb` to try out a few things.   (Note: the use of jupyter notebook is not a requirement to use the system; use whatever python
development environment is comfortable for you.)

### Minimal Environment

A more minimal environment is available for deployment using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/).  This installs this project and its depencies in your current python environment, but no extra tools:

```sh
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.9 is required.


### Using Project Drawdown Solutions as a package

If you would like to use this project as a dependency in _your_ code, you can do so by including the following line in your requirements.txt file:

```
      git+git://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions@develop
```


## Documentation

The main code documentation can be found at [https://projectdrawdown.github.io/solutions](https://projectdrawdown.github.io/solutions).  Additional documentation and some examples are in the [Documentation](https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions/tree/develop/Documentation) folder.
