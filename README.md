# Project Drawdown Model Engine
[Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/) is the most comprehensive plan yet published for how to solve Global Warming. Project Drawdown entered the climate conversation with the [publication of the 2017 book](https://www.drawdown.org/the-book). With [The Drawdown Review in 2020](https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework/drawdown-review-2020), the project continues its mission to inspire and communicate solutions.

This repository is an in-progress rewrite of the Project Drawdown model engine. This is intended to be a replacement for the series of interconnected Excel spreadsheets currently used by the project to do climate solution modeling. The intention is to create an implementation which will allow us to broaden the use of the climate solution models to policymakers, business leaders, and other decisionmakers and interested parties.

The codebase has some momentum already, has been continuously developed since September of 2018, and implements a substantial portion of the desired functionality. Planned deliverables and current status are listed below. We have also [recorded a video of the goals](https://youtu.be/Ffmx9KS-fW8), which allows demonstration where prototypes exist.

As of Nov 2020, CoLab Cooperative has begun implementing an REST API server to expose the model's functionality to a frontend consumer.

## Background

+ The Drawdown solution models are, at their core, economic models which estimate the total global and regional demand for each solution and the percentage of that demand each year which might adopt the Drawdown solution. The monetary and emissions impacts of that adoption are then calculated.

+ The framework and methodology for the model was developed by a core research team at Project Drawdown with a Head of Research and a set of Senior researchers who have worked with the project for several years.

+ The solutions have been developed by [annual cohorts of researchers](https://www.drawdown.org/research-fellows), mostly graduate and postdoctoral students working six month stints to vet new data inputs and implement targeted model improvements.

+ Project Drawdown's solution models were constructed in Excel, with a large number of Excel files now. There are two releases of the Excel models which are relevant to this effort:
    + 2019: released to the public in January 2019
    + 2020: extended from the 2019 models by a new cohort of researchers, released as The Drawdown Review in March 2020.

## Overview of the Project
Planned efforts include:

+ **Combined Model Implementation**  
Having copies of the underlying model in ~80 Excel files is no longer tenable, the level of toil involved in making substantial changes to the model is prohibitive. The project intends to deliver a single implementation in Python which can model the current ~80 solutions developed by Project Drawdown and allow easier development of more solution models in the future.
Current status:  
    + Python currently implements 70 out of the 80 Excel solution models of the 2019 version. The design doc for this effort was: [Drawdown Software Remodeling: backend models](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X9X-61CG26m0XTUmqKeGJwU-HinPELD9HwBO064b5dA/edit) (now considered complete).
    + The remaining 10 of the 80 are solutions which differ more extensively from the rest, like Food Waste and Family Planning. Python implementations of the remaining 10 solutions have not been started. There is nothing blocking effort on these, just lack of cycles.
    + Updates to the Python code to support the 2020 versions of the 70 solutions has begun, and several solutions from the 2020 Excel update are working.
    + Automated testing is a key goal of the Python effort, to enable future work on the model to proceed with confidence. To ensure the new implementation faithfully reproduces the original, there is a test which runs the Excel any Python models for a given solution and checks that their results match within a floating point margin of error at every step of the model calculation. There is a [YouTube video describing the levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6P56qUkCrw) of automated testing.
    + A nightly GitHub Action updates a [model health dashboard](https://projectdrawdown.github.io/solutions/), showing information about the solutions and their use of model features.

+ **UI aimed at researchers**  
We need a user interface aimed at individual solutions or a small handful of solutions, primarily for use by researchers looking to work with the model but additionally potentially of use to decisionmakers and policymakers in specific topics.  
Current status:  
    + There is a Jupyter UI to examine individual solutions, with a hosted instance running at https://solutions.geekhold.com/. There is a [video demonstrating its use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMrQwObdEZ4).
    + [Issue #13, "UI for Researcher use"](https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions/issues/13) tracks details.

+ **Solution Integration**  
 The individual solutions are modelled, but have to take the other solutions into account to produce final results. For example the set of energy solutions cannot add up to more than the total global demand for energy, and the land solutions cannot use more than the available land area of the planet. With the Excel models this is a manually intensive process. After a cohort of researchers finishes their work on the individual solutions, the senior researchers then spend several months combining, rationalizing, and finalizing the results.  

   The set of things to be done is varied:  

    + the sum of all Energy solutions must add up to the world demand for energy
    + the transportation solutions must be rationalized, though not the same way as energy as transport demand is somewhat elastic
    + some solutions provide feedstock for subsequent solutions, like biochar which needs wood scrap
    + World land area is allocated to the different land use solutions
    + Etc

   Much of this can be automated, by being able to run all of the solutions and incorporate a control loop with some simple rules for arbitrating between solutions. This effort has not been started, but could begin at any time. The ~70 completed Python solutions are believed to be sufficient to start such an effort.  

+ **UI aimed at broader audiences**  
We need better ways for people to explore the overall set of climate solutions and Drawdown results. This would be aimed at the complete set of solutions, or possibly to focus on an individual sector like Energy or Transportation. We also need ways to produce graphs, collateral for talks, and other presentable materials to further the mission of solutions for climate change. [Issue #12, "UI for multiple solutions"](https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions/issues/12) tracks details.

## Getting the source code

Note that develop has deviated considerably from master, and we haven't yet merged to master.

1. Get a copy of this source code:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions.git
$ cd solutions
$ git checkout develop
```

## Environment Variables

1. Copy the example
```
$ cp api/env-example api/.env
```

2. Valid OAuth keys will be necessary. See [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect) instructions for how to obtain these client ID and client secret keys. Update the .env file.
```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=somegithubclientid
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=somegithubclientsecret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=somegoogleclientid
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=somegoogleclientsecret
```

3. For running in production, you'll probably want a secure JWT secret key in the .env file as well:
```
JWT_SECRET_KEY=somejwtsecretkey
```

## Getting started with Docker

If you have docker and docker-compose installed, you should be able to get started fairly quickly, following these steps:

`$ cp docker-compose.yml.local.example docker-compose.yml`
`$ docker-compose build` to build the docker containers

## Getting started without Docker

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) (>= 3.8) installed. You will need [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) running.

Python 3.8
```sh
$ pipenv shell
# Or assuming you have multiple versions installed use the following 
$ pipenv --python /Users/sam/.pyenv/versions/3.8.6/bin/python shell
# Now inside the virtual env install tools
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Database Creation
You will need to have postgres running and you will need the psql program.
```sh
$ psql -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5432 -U postgres
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE drawdown;
```

If you're running the app via `docker-compose`, you may get the following error the first time you run:

```
db_1     | 2021-03-20 21:41:04.538 UTC [37] FATAL:  database "drawdown" does not exist
```

1. Having `docker-compose up` running (even if the web server fails)
2. Connect to the running DB container using `docker-compose exec -it db /bin/bash`
3. As above:

```sh
$ psql -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5432 -U postgres
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE drawdown;
```

*N.B.* There should be a way to initialize this via `docker-compose`.

## Running the project with Docker
`$ docker-compose up` to run the project

## Running the project without Docker

### Without docker, you will need to do a database setup

You will need to have postgres running. You will want a valid connection string contained in `api/.env` for `DATABASE_URL`. Using `pipenv shell` run the following to apply existing migrations:
```sh
$ alembic upgrade head
```

And finally, to run the API:
```sh
$ uvicorn api.service:app --reload
```

## Schema Updates
When changing models in `api/db/models.py` run the following to create migrations:
```sh
$ alembic revision -m "add provider column" --autogenerate
```

Note: if you are not using docker-compose, you will need to manually run:

```sh
$ alembic upgrade head
```

### Initializing the data

To create the default workbooks, use the `GET /initialize` endpoint. This will generate a variety of data, including the 3 Drawdown canonical workbooks. This will also load some CSVs into the database for easy retrieval, and provide the data for the `/resource/{path}` endpoints.

To improve performance for the app, it is recommended you run the `GET /calculate` endpoint for the 3 canonical workbooks as a first step, as this will cache results for all the technologies for the workbooks. Any variation updates, when calculated, will take advantage of this initial cache as much as possible.

### Some gotchas

When updating variation values, you may find you need to update like this:

```
"some_solution_variable": 1234.56
```

And other times, you may find you need to update the value like this:

```
"some_different_variable": {
  "value": 1234.56,
  "statistic": "mean"
}
```

This matches the existing .json files extracted from the original excel files. At some point, we may want to normalize all values to the second option, but for now just keep in mind you will need to know when to use which. You can access the `resource/scenario/{id}` endpoint to determine which format to send.
