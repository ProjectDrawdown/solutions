According to PJM (2011), VOM costs include expenses such as air filter replacements, inspections and overhauls, water treatment expenses, catalyst replacements, and major overhaul expenses. Given that these can occur in some cases over a number of years, the costs are divided by hours of operation to derive a cost per hour of operation, which is why these costs are reported in MWh. The MWh values for the IPCC minimum, median, and maximum VOM costs are input and then converted to kWh values.
